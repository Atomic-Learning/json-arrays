<p>In the JSON format, an array is used to store multiple pieces of data in an ordered list. The elements in the array may be of any type, including numbers, strings, or booleans. Different elements in the same array may be of different types.</p>

<p>Arrays are enclosed in square brackets [] and each element is separated by a comma. For readability, the following are conventional, but not required:
</p>
    
<ul>
  <li>Each element is placed on a new line.</li>
  <li>Elements are indented compared to the square brackets (often by two or four spaces).</li>
  <li>The closing square bracket is placed on a new line, aligned with the opening square bracket.</li>
  <li>If elements are on the same line, a space follows each comma.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following is an example of a JSON array containing numbers:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">[
  1,
  2,
  3,
  4,
  5
]</code></pre>

<p>The following is an example of a JSON array containing a mixture of different types:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">[
  1,
  "two",
  true,
  null,
]</code></pre>
